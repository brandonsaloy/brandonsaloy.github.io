        <br>-I hav nothing against Transgender ppl but shes not even pretty
        <br>-Reminds me of Ashton Kutcher!!
        <br>-Pretty
        <br>-Encouraging such thing is disgusting
        <br>-sand reading these comments :9 just because someone doesn't satisfy your expectations does not make them any less beautiful or any less of who they identify as. This is great news on my feed that someone who is public with their transition is being recognized, celebrated, and accepted into standardized establishments. So others won't be afraid to be themselves and not fear harmful ridicule. RIP Leelah Alcorn.
