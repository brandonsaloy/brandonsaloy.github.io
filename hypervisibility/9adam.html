	<p>"What did I tell you?" Adam did his dance: arms up, limp wrists, pop the hips. I love Adam; "best friend" flies out of my mouth when introducing him to people. "You've been, like, saying you're an <i>actress</i>/model forever...and now look, bitch! I can't even!" He blushed, giggled, and made a lap around the roof.</p>
    <p>Adam cuts through. Anxiety, depression, sleep deprivation, gender dysphoria, hangovers, impostor syndrome, or a pre-shoot fast can spoil me for days if three or four flare up at the same time. Adam is a good listener but a master of cheer.</p>
    <p>I shoved a Parliament in my mouth, lit it, and pulled so I could say, "Yeah, maybe you're right." The L.A. bags were packed, <i>Transparent</i> contracts <a href="10iamright.html">signed.</a></p>
