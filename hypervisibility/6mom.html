My mother frowned at me from the other side of the couch. Light poured into the living room and caught her hair, coiffed like Peggy Bundy's. Good news ignited my mother but never blinded her. There's no word for the sound she makes - it could be a squeal, but it's deeper, embodied. It's a sound only a woman can make, and she shared it with me. I might have been crying, but maybe I didn't start crying until I got to Los Angeles. She rejoiced, then frowned.</p>
