    <p><b>ethergaunts (11/13/2015):</b> For the record, I don't really give a shit what cis people have to say about you...It's mostly just the things I've discussed with my friends, a good many of whom are black trans women and trans women of color. I konw that with the added hypervisibility that fame and glamour brings to the table for any of the girls comes the hyperfocus on our politics to make sure we are squeaky clean in every possible regard. It's a fucked up level of pressure to put on someone because cis people, especially cis men, aren't held to these kinds of standards at all. Mostly bc cis men who have any level of fame or notoriety tend to be shitheads on multiple fronts...You're exploring relatively new territory bc the concept of trans women being both out about their transness while being even marginally famous is basically unheard of before the past few years, and I take that into consideration. You're also young, younger than me, and you should be able to fuck up and make mistakes just as readily as anyone else your age with the same repercussions visited upon your head that is visited upon theirs, and vice versa...</p>
    
    <p>But we both know that ain't happening anytime soon. And the fact that you aren't black or brown while trans, and aren't strapped for cash and struggling to find money for your next meal, or the bill in the mail, or the next month's worth of mones, or gas to and from work, or any of the other multitude of issues that a good number of the black and brown trans women on here are facing, and also still making mistakes that contribute to their struggle, indirectly as it may seem, or belittle them and remind them of their place as an oppressed individual within our society, or be contrarian to their more nuanced and developed understanding of the interplay of race, class, gender, etc., is leaving these girls feeling something way beyond pressed...Rightfully so, <a href="11tumblr3.html">truthfully. </a></p>
