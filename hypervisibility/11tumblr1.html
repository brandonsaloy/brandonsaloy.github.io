	<p>Tumblr feels subterranean, so I stay. I seem raw on other social media, but I only seem. Twitter gets <font color="#55acee">#funny</font>, Instagram gets <font color="#125688">#pretty</font>, and Tumblr gets topless pics, vulgar memes, and stoned 4 a.m. text posts written in the tag bar so only followers can read them. As my followers crept toward 30,000, I could see only 30 when I posted. I reported to them wide-eyed, or smug; I took space without concequences, until I couldn't.</p>
    
    <p>I search my name on Tumblr more than I Google myself, and I Google myself every day. Critics gather in the blue grid - of my politics, privilage unchecked. they got me for messy Caitlyn discourse ("Don't <i>let</i> her affect you if you don't want to be affected <i>by</i> her!"), a defense of Rihanna's last Met Gala dress ("It was so big that it transcended cultural appropriation"), some jab to a hater about how much money I was making. The critiques were good, and they were coming from trans women, so they hurt. Tumblr user <font color="#32506d">@etherguants</font> made some of the best, so I messaged her, and she <a href="11tumblr2.html">responded:</a></p>
