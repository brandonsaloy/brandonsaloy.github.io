<p>Laverne Cox turned around. I'd called her name, but calling a name didn't mean much on the Emmy's red carpet. Even so, she turned around (I couldn't believe it), so I waddled over to hug and double-kiss her, and I asked her whom she was wearing.</p>

<p>"Custom Calvin Klein Collection by Francisco Costa," she claimed.</p>

<p>Saint Laurent by Hedi Slimane," I croaked.</p>

<p>She smiled. I don't remember what she said next, only that I loved her and wanted to tell her everything. She made me shy, and I thought about her every day.</p>

<p>A Netflix PR agent led her towards Giuliana Rancic in the E! News <a href="9adam.html"> booth.</a></p>
