	<p>The journalist interviewed me over late lunch in an empty Chelsea pub; I inhaled an arugula salad. She'd been following me all day, and I hadn't eaten much.</p>
    
    <p>She said something like, "How does it feel, as a trans woman, to have seen this incredible moment take root for your community?" </p>
    
    <p>I replied with something like, "What do you mean?" because I didn't know.</p>
    
    <p>"Well, it seems like visiblity and understanding for trans people was - even just representation - was scarce only two or three years ago," said the journalist. "So I'm wondering how you feel - you know, to have seen this...and play a relatively prominent role in it...it seems like things have changed so fast for you."</p>
    
    <p>"How does it feel? I replied, because I didn't know.</p>
    
    <p>"Are you surprised? Relieved? Are you proud? Are you shocked? You've stepped up to do your part, but did you expect this? How does it feel to have seen this take root, and how does that relate to your identity as a trans person?"</p>
    
    <p>"I never saw this moment take root."</p>
    
    <p>"What do you mean?" the journalist <a href="13interview.html">asked.</a></p>
