    <p>Deadlines are some of the most important things to keep mind of when applying to any type of college. All colleges have certain deadlines for when students need apply, so go to all of your prospective college’s websites and acquire all of the deadlines that you need to abide by. They’re scary, but very important. It’s always good to apply by “early decision” deadlines so that you have priority acceptance and are showing that you are proactive about showing interest in a given school.
