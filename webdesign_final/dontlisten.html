	<h1>Don't Listen To Your Dad</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Over the course of applying to art school, which, in and of itself can be an expensive undertaking, your father or other male figure in your life is going to tell you that this is a waste of time. He may be right. But he’s also not being helpful. So just shut all of that nonsense out of your head and focus on what you need to do to better yourself. It’s not like he’s all that successful anyway!
