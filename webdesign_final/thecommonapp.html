    <br>
    <br>
    <p>The Common App is a single application that many schools accept, and therefore allow you fill out one application for, say, four schools, instead of four individual ones. I was told that the majority of schools accept The Common App. Depending on the schools you are interested in, this may or may not be true. I filled out The Common App and it took a very long time. I ended up sending it to exactly zero schools. So just make sure youâ€™re keeping track of what schools need what applications.
