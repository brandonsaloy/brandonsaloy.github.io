	<h1>Making an Informed Descision</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>If you got into one school, this is a very simple step. If you got into multiple schools, this can be very difficult. It’s important to think about how much each school will cost and which ones you and your family can afford. If you really want to go to an expensive school and your dad is going to pay for it, go for it. He probably didn’t like you that much to begin with anyway. If you’re going to pay for this school with thousands of dollars in private loans, you  may want to rethink things. Or go for it. Either way you’re going to be owned by the man eventually and be dead in about 70 years, so what does it matter?
Pro tip: if you don’t like your family very much, go to the school farthest from you! You’ll only have to see them maybe three times a year and by the time you graduate they won’t even remember your name. College is magic.
